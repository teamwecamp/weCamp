As our kids started attending summer camps, we started seeing all the confusion and chaos parents experience when trying to plan a fun and enriching summer for their kids. Us too. Ultimately, the process is unnecessarily overwhelming and stressful for parents. In a world of technology, it doesn't need to be so complicated to accomplish such a simple task. Schedule my kids in camps they enjoy with friends. How hard can it be?! If you've done it, you know how misaligned it is. As a former IT consultant, every problem has a solution. If there's a problem screaming for a solution, it's summer camp planning!
